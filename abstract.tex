This thesis presents the classification performance of applying transfer learning techniques to top quark tagging in simulated data for the ATLAS detector at CERN at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. Deep learning models pretrained on \textsc{Delphes} simulated jets and then fine tuned on \textsc{Geant4} simulations are shown to outperform those only trained on \textsc{Geant4} simulation data. The performance improvement is found to be largest in data scarce regimes and provides a potential alternative to using computationally expensive simulation data.
